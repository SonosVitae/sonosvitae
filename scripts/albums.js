        "I started writing this album in the meantime while I was recording instruments for 'Sonos Vitae'. I finished it by the end of the summer.
        Some tracks were made for different projects so that's why some of them don't fit so well into the 'theme'. But over all, I'm happy with
        what turned out!
        I hope u enjoy this release!"
        
        Big Thanks:
        To my family for endless love and support! To my friends Plantixx, Krykszyn, FollowTheCloud and Ada Hope for listening and giving feedback.`,

        description: `Original Soundtrack for a "Beyond R: Rule Ripper"

        An evolving death game set in a bar, where getting to know its players is the only way out.Each person hides one of the game's rules. Discover them through their pasts, tastes, and finding hidden clues, then face them in an all-out discussion. Only three can survive, unless you fight back.

        As the first thing I wanted to say, Thank you everyone who made this soundtrack possible, my family for their endless support, my friends who helped me polish the project and especially big thanks to the main developer himself for a wonderful collaboration!

        It is in fact my first soundtrack in my career so there was a lot of trial and error at the beginning.This OST was made over the course of 3-4 years with monthly breaks, with many tracks written at the very start and others at the very end of the project.There was a lot of progress throughout the years, some tracks were constantly changing over time, for example "Prodding Cues" version in the game is the fourth iteration.Overall I didn't want to completely change original compositions. When I was recomposing them I wanted to keep the main Idea and structure while adding more complexity and better instrumentation.

        I hope you enjoy the game as well as the music and I hope we will meet again in the future!

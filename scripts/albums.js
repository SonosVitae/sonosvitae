        "I started writing this album in the meantime while I was recording instruments for 'Sonos Vitae'. I finished it by the end of the summer.
        Some tracks were made for different projects so that's why some of them don't fit so well into the 'theme'. But over all, I'm happy with
        what turned out!
        I hope u enjoy this release!"
        
        Big Thanks:
        To my family for endless love and support! To my friends Plantixx, Krykszyn, FollowTheCloud and Ada Hope for listening and giving feedback.`,

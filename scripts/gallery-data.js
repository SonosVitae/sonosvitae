        title: "Beyond R: Rule Ripper Soundtrack Release!",
        text: `Today marks the release of my first seriously composed game soundtrack for *Beyond R: Rule Ripper*, also known as “the Spaniards” game.

        It’s a project I worked on for about four years starting in 2021, creating the music, sound design, drawing assets, and handling various other tasks. It’s a visual novel in the death game genre. The story takes place in a bar, and getting to know the other players is the only way to survive. Each person holds one of several game rules—uncover them through their past, their preferences, and hidden clues. Confront them in open discussion, because only three people can survive—unless you defend yourself.

        Overall, I’d like to thank everyone who contributed to the creation of this soundtrack:

        * The best guitarist I know, who played on several tracks: Marek Szorc
        * My family for their constant support
        * My friends who helped me refine the project
        * And, of course, the creator of the game

        Over the years, I made significant improvements to the quality of the tracks, so some pieces kept evolving. For example, the version of “Prodding Cues” featured in the game is already its fourth iteration. In general, I didn’t want to completely change the original compositions. When recreating them toward the end, my goal was to preserve the core idea and structure while improving the instrumentation.

        I hope you enjoy both the music and the game!`,
